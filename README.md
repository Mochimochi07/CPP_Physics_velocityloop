# CPP_Physics_velocityloop

Its a C++ simulation example about velocity, time and position.
I know its kinda hard to make this but i might consider xojo in data science now.
Xojo is good for front end because of the drag and drop.
And thats a huge plus for databases visualization and other things.
I just need to know how do i make those things.
